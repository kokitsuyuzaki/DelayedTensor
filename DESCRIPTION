Description: DelayedTensor operates Tensor arithmetic directly on
    DelayedArray object. DelayedTensor provides some generic function related to
    Tensor arithmetic/decompotision and dispatches it on the DelayedArray class.
    DelayedTensor also suppors Tensor contraction by einsum function,
    which is inspired by numpy einsum.
