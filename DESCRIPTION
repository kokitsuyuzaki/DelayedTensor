Description: DelayedTensor operates Tensor arithmetic directly on DelayedArray object. DelayedTensor provides some generic function related to Tensor arithmetic/decompotision and dispatches it on the DelayedArray class. DelayedTensor also suppors Tensor contraction by einsum function, which is inspired by numpy einsum.
