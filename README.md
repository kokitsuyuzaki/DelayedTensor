# DelayedTensor
Block-processed version of rTensor functions to perform tensor arithmetic and decomposition.
All the calculations are actually performed and not registered as delayed operartion.
DelayedTensor provides some generic function related to Tensor arithmetic/decompotision and dispatches it on the DelayedArray class.
DelayedTensor also suppors Tensor contraction by einsum function, which is inspired by numpy einsum.

Installation of Dependent Packages

  c("DelayedArray", "HDF5Array", "BiocSingular", "rTensor",
    "DelayedRandomArray", "einsum", "BiocStyle", "knitr",
    "markdown", "rmarkdown", "testthat", "magrittr", "dplyr"),
  suppressUpdates=TRUE)
```
